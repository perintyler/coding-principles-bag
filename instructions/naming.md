# Naming Principles

Names are the most-read part of any codebase. A good name removes the need for a comment, a bad name creates the need for three. Naming well is compression — fitting the right meaning into the smallest surface area.

## Core Philosophy

**Say what it is, not how it works.** A name should tell you what something represents or what it does, at the level of abstraction you're currently in. Implementation details belong in the body.

**Use the domain vocabulary.** If the domain calls it a "storyboard," call it a `Storyboard`. Don't invent synonyms — match the words the problem space already uses.

**Shorter is better — until it's ambiguous.** `canvas` over `canvasInstance`. `prompt` over `promptString`. But `queryTerms` over `terms` when `terms` could mean anything.

## Patterns

### Classes: noun or noun phrase, role-clear

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Domain object | `Lyric`, `Scene`, `MusicVideo`, `SampleSet`, `Beats` |
| Actor / service | `Poller`, `Prompter`, `Evaluator`, `Generator` |
| Action noun | `NotificationsCreator`, `UrlResolver`, `SlopDetector` |
| Qualified noun | `RandomSampler`, `MoveOrdering`, `StoryboardJobQueue` |

- `RandomSampler` — two words, complete mental model. The name is the architecture.
- `MoveOrdering` — describes the data structure's purpose, not its implementation (it's a priority queue underneath, but the name says what it *means*).
- `Poller` — you don't need `CanvasPollerService` because the namespace (`Canvas::Poller`) already scopes it.
- Avoid `Manager` / `Handler` / `Helper` / `Utils` — if you can't name it more specifically, the class probably does too much.

### Functions and methods: verb or verb phrase

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Verb + object | `randomizeSound`, `lockKey`, `sendMessage`, `getPitchName` |
| Question | `isKeyLocked`, `isBlackKey`, `has_idle_jobs`, `is_complete` |
| Find/search | `find_attacks`, `find_moves`, `find_captures`, `find_strong_captures` |

- `explore_leaves` — names the action at the right abstraction level. Not `minimaxAlphaBetaSearch`, which describes the technique. The docstring explains how.
- `find_attacks` / `find_moves` / `find_captures` / `find_strong_captures` — a graduated family. The narrowing scope is in the names.
- `create_playlist_from_grouptext` — reads like a sentence. You know the input and the output without reading the signature.
- When a class represents a single action, the method name can be minimal: `call` (Ruby services), `execute` (workflows). The class name carries the meaning.
- Avoid `doX`, `processX`, `handleX` — vague verbs that defer meaning. And avoid redundant context: `canvas.getCanvasTitle()` — it's already a canvas, just `title`.

### Variables: the thing itself

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Domain term | `chapter`, `lyric`, `scene`, `pieceType`, `colorToMove` |
| State flag | `isRecording`, `foundValidSample`, `moveIsACapture` |
| Inline clarity | `friends` / `enemies` (aliasing `colors[color]` / `colors[not color]`) |

- `friends` and `enemies` — aliasing array indices in a chess move generator. The data doesn't change, but the names make the logic read like chess instead of array indexing.
- `moveIsACapture` — reads as a sentence. Not `isCap` or `captureFlag`.
- `rootNoteOfSample` — verbose but unambiguous in a function where `key`, `note`, and `rootNote` all mean slightly different things. Length earns its keep when it prevents confusion.
- `indexCanStorePiece` — the variable name *is* the condition's explanation.
- Avoid `data`, `result`, `temp`, `val`, `item` — generic names that force you to read surrounding code.

### Constants: static facts

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Limits / sizes | `MAX_NUM_POLLS`, `OCTAVE_SIZE`, `BATCH_SIZE` |
| Timing | `POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`, `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`, `FRAMES_PER_SECOND` |
| Domain | `PITCH_NAMES`, `BLACK_NOTES`, `SPOTIFY_SONG_ADDING_THRESHOLD` |

- `OCTAVE_SIZE` — not `TWELVE` or `NUM_NOTES`. Names the concept, not the value.
- `MIDI_NUMBER_OF_FIRST_FRET` — long, but no one will misread it. In a domain where integers represent multiple things, precision is worth the characters.
- `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` — unit in the name prevents confusion.

### Types and interfaces: describe the shape

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Options bag | `SearchOptions`, `RelevanceOptions`, `AudioOptions` |
| Semantic alias | `using Note = int`, `SampleFilterFunction`, `NoteAndSample` |
| Event | `TranscriptionEvent`, `ConnectionEvent`, `AudioEvent` |

- `using Note = int` — a MIDI note *is* an int, but calling it `Note` means the code reads as music, not arithmetic. Type aliases earn their keep when a primitive has domain meaning.

## Namespace and file structure

Good namespace structure lets individual names stay short. The namespace carries the qualifying context.

```
Canvas::Poller              — not CanvasPollerService
Canvas::RefreshWorkflow     — not CanvasRefreshWorkflowService
Recommendations::UrlResolver — not RecommendationUrlResolverService

chess/evaluate.py → Evaluator — not ChessPositionEvaluator
chess/moves.py    → Generator — not ChessMoveGenerator
```

File name matches the primary export: `beats.py` exports `Beats`, `scene.py` exports `Scene`.

Directories can be metaphors: `storyboard/` (content planning) and `editing_room/` (video assembly). The metaphor *is* the architecture. Never `utils/` or `helpers/`.

## Rules of Thumb

1. **If you need a comment to explain what a variable holds, rename it.** `indexCanStorePiece` doesn't need a comment. `idx` does.
2. **If the name has "and" in it, the thing does too much.** Split it.
3. **Match the abstraction level.** A workflow says `execute(canvas_token)`. An activity says `execute(canvas_token, agent_id, request_id, poll_attempt)`. The workflow speaks in business terms, the activity in technical ones.
4. **Booleans read as assertions.** `isKeyLocked`, `foundValidSample`, `moveIsACapture` — read them in an `if` and they should form a sentence.
5. **Use symmetry.** `lockKey` / `unlockKey`. `addSoundSource` / `removeSoundSource`. `startRecording` / `stopRecording`. Symmetric operations get symmetric names.
6. **Plural = collection, singular = instance.** `scenes` is a list, `scene` is one. Never `sceneList` or `channelArray` — don't encode the container type.
7. **Abbreviate only universally understood terms.** `id`, `url`, `env`. Not `rec` for recommendation, not `notif` for notification.
8. **Follow the platform.** `snake_case` in Ruby and Python, `camelCase` in TypeScript and JavaScript, `PascalCase` for C++ classes, `SCREAMING_SNAKE` for constants everywhere.
