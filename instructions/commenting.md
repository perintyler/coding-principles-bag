# Comment Principles

Comment should explain _why_, never _what_. Comments are only neccessary if they add information that's not already derivable from the code itself. They should be simple, brief, and devoid of overly-technical jargon.

Clean code is usually self-documenting. So whenever writing a comment, these questions must be asked:

1. Could we convey the same information by variables or breaking steps into functions with descriptive names
2. Would a competent developer understand this code without the comment?
3. Would this comment make sense for someone without domain/codebase expertise?

## Examples of Effective Comments

| Comment | Why it's good |
|---------|---------------|
| `Using 30s timeout because vendor API is slow` | It explains the why. It conveys information that isn't conveyable in code, since it relates to context about how a 3rd party service and how it relates to the software being built. |
| `Workaround for Chrome bug #12345: https://link-to-github-issue.com` | It explains an intentional and neccessary quirk in the code and provides information on how to learn more about the reason for the quirk |
