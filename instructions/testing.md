# Testing Principles

**Test what the user sees, not how the code works.**

Tests should answer: "if this broke, would a user notice?" If yes, test it. If no, skip it.

## Do

- **Test behavior at boundaries** — where data enters or leaves your system (API responses, parsed external data, data shapes consumed by UI)
- **Test where sources diverge** — when multiple APIs send the same concept in different formats, prove they normalize to one
- **Test branching logic that matters** — fallbacks, precedence rules, derived values
- **Test that bad input doesn't crash** — empty responses, malformed JSON, missing fields

## Don't

- **Don't test plumbing** — constants, pass-through arguments, trivial wrappers, that JS assignment works
- **Don't test internal helpers directly** — if the public API exercises them, they're already covered. If you refactor them away, the tests shouldn't break.
- **Don't test absence of features** — "unknown stat types are skipped" adds no value

## Principles

- **One integration test beats ten unit tests** — a pipeline test (DB row -> transform -> verify shape) catches more real bugs than testing each function in isolation
- **If the test must change in lockstep with the code, it's testing implementation** — tests should survive refactoring
- **Focus effort by risk** — areas that break most often, are critical for users, have tricky integrations, or involve complex parsing
- **Coverage is not quality** — what you test matters more than the number
